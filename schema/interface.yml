  Interfaces as their primary have a role that is upstream, downstream,
  guest, ....
type: object

  role:
    description:
      The role defines if the interface is upstream or downstream facing.
    type: string
    enum:
    - upstream
    - downstream
  isolate-hosts:
    description:
      This option makes sure that any traffic leaving this interface is isolated
      and all local IP ranges are blocked. It essentially enforces "guest network"
      firewall settings.
